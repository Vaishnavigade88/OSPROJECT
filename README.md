## Project Description

The **Ticket Booking System** is a multi-threaded system developed in C that simulates multiple users booking seats simultaneously. The system uses semaphores to handle synchronization and prevent race conditions, ensuring that no two users can book the same seat at the same time.

---

## Features

- Multi-threaded seat booking system
- User-friendly interface for seat selection
- Prevents race conditions using semaphores
- Displays real-time seat availability

---

## System Requirements

- **Language:** C
- **Libraries:** pthread, semaphore.h
- **Operating System:** Linux (or any system supporting pthreads and semaphores)

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaishnavigade88/ticket-booking-system.git
